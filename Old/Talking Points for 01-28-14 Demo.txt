Idea:

-split screen into 4 panes: code, visualization, comments/lecture, and stack frame + quizzes while running through solution code

-c

Module:

- reuse interface for multiple examples (progress through labs in a linear fashion that gradually introduces new ideas)
- Some of them will be redundant in concept (like factorial and string recursion) in order to drill home ideas
