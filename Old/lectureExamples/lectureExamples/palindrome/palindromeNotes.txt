Palindrome Checking

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or elements,
that can be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction.

Here are some examples: "1234321", "detartrated", "as", "hi", "I"

So, if we start with an empty string or a single character and we
add any character to both sides we'll still have a palindrome.

""
"nn"
"anna"

or

"e"
"cec"
"aceca"
"racecar"

We could determine if some text is a palindrome iteratively but there is a nice recursive solution.
Recursively we can break the text into smaller and smaller pieces opposite of how we built palindromes up earlier.

1. If the text is empty or a single character, you've got a palindrome.
2. If the first and last characters of the text are the same, recursively test the rest of the text.
3. If they aren't, the text isn't a palindrome.
